# KentOutreach

Collaborated with Kent Outreach to create a website that can help people learn more about the company. People are able to attain help by filling out a form 
that will be sent directly to the company. This website would help both company and consumers to get a quick response back with the help of automating paperwork that usually takes 
hours to do. 
Worked with a team to develop the website.
